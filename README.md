# Degenooru
_Degenooru_ is a .NET 5.0+ library written in C#, designed for accessing the APIs of numerous different sites, namely image boards.

Why image boards? Because I thought it was funny.

### Why "Degenooru"?
That's pretty simple, _Degenooru_ is a portmanteau of "degenerate" and "booru", a self-explanatory name if I do say so myself.

By extension, the back-end API of _Degenooru_ is called `Berate` because it consists of the missing letters from both original words (**b**ooru and degen**erate**). It was only by chance that it happened to spell out an actual word.
